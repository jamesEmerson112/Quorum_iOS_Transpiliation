This application example is an example of a project generated entirely with the "Send to iOS" button in Quorum studio, using a modified Skybox template.

The modifications were mainly to input monitoring, as the monitor raised an issue with a missing lwjgl class, this monitoring was replaced with automatic rotation for demonstration purposes.

Features:

 - Illustrates successful image asset manipulation
 - Illustrates successful iOS graphics native integration
